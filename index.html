                <h1> KickStart Crowdfunding Service </h1><br/><br/>
                <ul>Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, 
                    but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects aunched on Kickstarter, only a third 
                    have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.<br><br>
                    Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations 
                    spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. <br><br>
                    This work you will organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

                    <li><h3>Analysis by Category</h3>
                        The most successful projects regardless of country or year are under the categories of music and theater 
                        (those were also the kinds of projects with the highest support from their backers) The level of backer support 
                        was determinant on the level of success of the various categories in which the projects were presented.
                         A lesser level of support by backers for films and video projects was directly associated with a lower number of 
                         successful outcomes on those projects. (Click on the graph to get the source worksheet)

                    <li><h3>Analysis by Sub-Category</h3>
                        Again, the direct relationship between the success of a project and the level of engagement of the backers can be
                        easily observe. Case in point the subcategory plays; which has a very high percentage of backers support, 
                        shows a high level of successful outcomes. (Click on the graph to get the source worksheet)

                    <li><h3>Analysis by Month/Year</h3>                           
                        In a year and month comparison we can see that the tendency of success as an outcome to a project was higher 
                        during the Month of May and lowest in December. (Click on the graph to get the source worksheet)
